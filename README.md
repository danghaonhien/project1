Create a new repository in GitHub called Project1 .

Inside this folder, create the following: Html file and css file for styling and script.js file and map.js file and we use semantic as framework. 
This project called gas station finder, and it works on browser when you run it. You just have to click on the search button 
then it will ask you to give permission to read your location and it will return what gas stations name and address and what service they have nearby you. We use Js and jQuerey to build this project. 
We also use geolocation function to return to us two values. One for latitude and the another for longitude ,also we use Google Places function to build this project. This function will use the latitude , longitude values  we got from geolocation function to build the map and return what gas stations nearby us and put it on the map with red markers. When you click on the red marker, the gas station name will show.
